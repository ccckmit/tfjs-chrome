# TensorFlow.js Examples (Simplified by ccc)

This project is modified from the Tensorflow.js examples from the following url:

https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples

No ES6 syntax preprocessing is needed. Just copy the example folder onto a server and visit http://server:port/folder/index.html by any browser that support async/await javascript syntax (Chrome  65.0.3325.181 on iMac was tested)

You may use live-server to run server on localhost as following.

```
$ yarn global add live-server
$ cd mnist
csienqu-teacher:mnist csienqu$ live-server
Serving ".../mnist" at http://127.0.0.1:8080
Ready for changes
```

## Original Notice

This rentains a set of examples implemented in
[TensorFlow.js](http://js.tensorflow.org).pository co

Each example directory is standalone so the directory can be copied
to another project.
